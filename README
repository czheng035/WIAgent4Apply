This is just an project for the review of my application to GSoC2012
All copyrights reserved

Functions:
Detect window.navigator.startActivity() and display the action and type in its
intent parameter, a process of displaying JavaScript in Android.

Now only work for two links from webintents.org

http://examples.webintents.org/intents/shorten/shorten.html

http://examples.webintents.org/usage/startActivity/index.html (Home when
launched)

Not working for other links because their invocations are located in different
iframes. (Todo)

A toast "Ready" shows it has finished page loading for testing.
